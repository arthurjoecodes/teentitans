Teen Titans Go! (TTG) is an American animated television series that premiered on Cartoon Network on April 23, 2013 and is based on the DC Comics fictional superhero team. The series was announced following the popularity of DC Nation's New Teen Titans shorts.[2] The production companies of the series are DC Entertainment and Warner Bros. Animation, with the animation outsourced to Canada at Copernicus Studios and Bardel Entertainment.[3]
Sporting a different animation style, Teen Titans Go! serves as a comedic spin-off with little or no continuity to the previous series (although some references are included as comedic fan service) or any other media in the DC Comics franchise. Many DC characters make cameo appearances and are referenced in the background. The original principal voice cast returns to reprise their respective roles. This series explores what the Titans do when they are hanging out around the tower.
A feature film, Teen Titans Go! To the Movies, was released in theaters on July 27, 2018.
Teen Titans Go! is an animated series that follows the adventures of the young Titans: Beast Boy, Cyborg, Raven, Starfire and Robin. They reside in Jump City when they are not saving the world while living together as teenagers without adults who intrude. Unlike most of the other superhero series, the situations are comic, crazy and parodic—for example, juvenile jokes that reach new heights of danger,

obtaining a license to drive after destroying the Batmobile or washing the suits after staining them when fighting their enemies. The show regularly features characters who have appeared in the original series, albeit with reduced roles and/or exaggerated personalities. It also features greater attachment to the DC Universe at large, with more references to other characters including those in the Justice League, plus a few appearances by Batman and Commissioner Gordon in lighthearted moments.
The show expresses in-jokes regarding the whole of DC's library, many of them in blink-and-you'll-miss-it moments, as well as numerous jokes at the expense of the show itself. The show has also several cameo crossovers with the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles franchise; specifically the 2012 series, in which Greg Cipes and Scott Menville also participated as voice actors. Particularly the episode "Truth, Justice, and What?" and Teen Titans Go! To the Movies feature guest appearances by the Turtles.[4]
Teen Titans Go! has received generally mixed reviews by critics. Common Sense Media gave the show 4 out of 5 stars and wrote that it "manages a few positive messages alongside the clever comedy and characterizations".[5] IGN writer Scott Collura gave the pilot episode a score of 7.8 out of 10, stating that "DC Animation revamps the beloved Teen Titans series for a new generation – with pretty fun results".[6]

<h3>their funny</h3>

Randy Schiff of The Buffalo News praised its writing and animation, calling it a "consistently quirky comedy that is often laced with keen social commentary".[7] After the trailer for the series' film adaptation was released, Scott Mendelson of Forbes praised the series and its "nihilistic madness", writing that "Taken on its own terms, it is blisteringly funny and endlessly clever, offering grimly cynical history lessons, comedically grimdark holiday specials, and occasional pure fantasy freak-outs...amid some serious superhero genre trolling and self-commentary."[8] The first season currently holds an approval rating of 67% based on 9 reviews on review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes.[9]
Writing for Slant Magazine, Lee Wang gave the show 2 stars out of 4, saying "Teen Titans Go! would offer little to even the most ardent Titans nostalgists and completists".[10] Aaron Wiseman of Moviepilot cited various criticisms of the show, noting slight appreciation for the characters of Starfire and Raven.[11] Joseph Murphy of the website The show's pilot episode brought in over 3 million viewers. On June 11, 2013, Cartoon Network renewed Teen Titans Go! for a second season, citing successful ratings.[12] According to Hope King, a tech reporter for CNNMoney,[13] Teen Titans Go! was one out of three of the most viewed television shows and other media to contribute to a record setting 1.3 million simultaneous Xfinity On-Demand viewings during the January 2016 United States blizzard.[14]
